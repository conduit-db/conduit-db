- Can I push the "accounting and acking state" down into a class for this ("SyncState") and just call methods on this object?
- Can I push the "worker_in_queue" to a class: WorkerInQueues?
- Can I push the "worker_in_queue" to a class: WorkerAckQueues?
- Can I push the "worker_in_queue" to a class: WorkerOutQueues?
- Can I push the header state (events and target height etc.) down into a class for "HeaderState" and BlockHeaderState?
